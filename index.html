        <h2>1. A 30-Second Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity comes in two parts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Special Relativity</strong> (1905) – shows that space and time are woven together into spacetime, and that moving clocks tick slower.</li>
            <li><strong>General Relativity</strong> (1915) – adds gravity, predicting that clocks in stronger gravity also run slower.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Combined, these ideas let different observers disagree about <em>which</em> events happen first. In extreme cases, the order can flip—making it look as if time ran backward. Below we break this down with numbers and cartoons you can play with.

            Drag the slider to set a ship's speed. Watch how its onboard clock slows according to the famous factor
            <code>γ = 1 / √(1-v²/c²)</code>.

            <code>Δt_far / Δt_near ≈ 1 + GM/(rc²)</code>.

    <!-- ============ BACKWARDS TIME ============ -->
    <section id="backwards">
        <h2>4. How Can Time Appear to Run Backwards?</h2>
        <p>
            Relativity never makes <em>your own</em> clock tick backward, but it does let the <strong>sequence</strong> of two distant events swap for observers moving fast enough. Below is Einstein's train-and-lightning thought experiment.
        </p>

        <div id="trainBox">
            <div id="boltLeft"></div>
            <div id="boltRight"></div>
            <div id="train">
                <div id="wheel1"></div><div id="wheel2"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="caption" id="trainCaption">
            Ground observer: bolts hit <strong>simultaneously</strong>.
        </div>

        <button id="perspectiveBtn" style="margin-top:.8rem;padding:.4rem 1rem;border:none;background:#1d3557;color:#fff;border-radius:4px">Switch to Train's Perspective</button>

        <p>
            Because simultaneity is relative, the passenger concludes the <em>front</em> bolt struck first. For them, the rear event lies in their "future," so the ground observer's ordering looks flipped—<strong>as if time reversed at the back of the train</strong>. This reversal is geometric, not magical: no observer ever violates cause-and-effect along their own timeline.
        </p>

        <h3>So, can we travel into our own past?</h3>
        <p>
            General Relativity admits exotic solutions (rotating black holes, wormholes) that contain closed time-like curves—paths that loop to the past. Whether nature allows them is unknown; most physicists suspect quantum effects shut the door. For now, "backwards time" remains a fascinating <em>possibility</em>, not an engineering blueprint.
